skupper-service
===============

Creates all services defined through the `services` variable for the
related ansible host.

It creates the service, binding it to all (optional) targets.

Requirements
------------

* Skupper CLI

Role Variables
--------------

A `services` array element must be defined at the host, so that the role
can iterate through each service, creating and binding it to the defined
target.

```yaml
services:
  # Sample service definition (indexed by name)
  name:
    ports: []           # int array
    protocol: ""        # choice tcp, http, http2
    labels: []          # label and value separated by equal sign
    aggregate: ""       # choice: json, multiplart
    enableTls: False    # boolean
    eventChannel: False # boolean
    targets: []         # array of type and name
      type: ""          # type of target to bind (values vary based on selected platform)
      name: ""          # value that represents the selected target type
      ports: []         # array mapping service ports to target ports

    #
    # kubernetes flags
    #
    # valid targetType values: "deployment", "statefulset", "pods", "service"
    #

    #
    # podman flags
    #
    # valid targetType values: "host"
    containerName: ""   # optinal alternative name for service container
    hostIp: ""          # optional host ip address used to bind to the service ports
    hostPorts: []       # array mapping service ports to a host port

```

Example Inventory
-----------------

The following inventory example, demonstrates how an ansible host
can be specified. Note that it has the `services` field.

```yaml
  site-a:
    services:
      nginx:
        ports:
          - 8080
        labels:
          - label1=value1
          - label2=value2
  site-b:
    services:
      nginx:
        ports:
          - 8080
        targets:
          - type: deployment
            name: nginx
  rhel9:
    services:
      nginx:
        ports: [8080]
        targets:
          - type: "host"
            name: "192.168.122.1"
        hostIp: "192.168.122.1"
        hostPorts:
          - 8080:8888
```
