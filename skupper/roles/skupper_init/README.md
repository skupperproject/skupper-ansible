skupper_init
============

Initializes a Skupper site using the CLI

Requirements
------------

Skupper CLI must be installed.

Role Variables
--------------

This role expects an init object to be provided as a host variable.
The init object is composed by the following fields:

```yaml
init:
  
  #
  # common flags
  #

  siteName: ""
  ingress: ""
  routerMode: ""
  labels: []
  routerLogging: ""
  routerDebugMode: ""
  timeout: 0
 
  #
  # kube specific flags
  #
  
  ingressHost: ""
  createNetworkPolicy: False
  enableServiceSync: False
  enableConsole: False
  consoleAuth: ""
  consoleUser: ""
  consolePassword: ""
  consoleIngress: ""
  annotations: []
  ingressAnnotations: []
  routerServiceAnnotations: []
  controllerServiceAnnotations: []
  routers: 1
  routerCpu: ""
  routerMemory: ""
  routerCpuLimit: ""
  routerMemoryLimit: ""
  routerNodeSelector: ""
  routerPodAffinity: ""
  routerPodAntiaffinity: ""
  routerIngressHost: ""
  routerLoadBalancerIp: ""
  controllerCpu: ""
  controllerMemory: ""
  controllerCpuLimit: ""
  controllerMemoryLimit: ""
  controllerNodeSelector: ""
  controllerPodAffinity: ""
  controllerPodAntiaffinity: ""
  controllerIngressHost: ""
  controllerLoadBalancerIp: ""
  configSyncCpu: ""
  configSyncMemory: ""
  configSyncCpuLimit: ""
  configSyncMemoryLimit: ""

  #
  # podman specific flags
  #

  ingressHosts: []
  ingressBindIps: []
  bindPort: 55671
  bindPortEdge: 45671
  containerNetwork: "skupper"
  podmanEndpoint: ""
```

All the fields are optional, except for the ingressHosts on podman sites.

A podman site requires that the ingressHosts array is populated, as the
provided addresses will be used as the hosts in the TLS certificate used
for mTLS when linking sites.

Dependencies
------------

**Role**

* skupper_common

Example Playbook
----------------

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - skupper_init
```

Example Inventory
-----------------

The following inventory example, demonstrates how an ansible host
can be specified. Note that it has the platform variable as well 
as the `init` field.

```yaml
  rhel9:
    platform: "podman"
    init:
      ingressHosts:
        - 192.168.122.1
        - 192.168.15.10
```
